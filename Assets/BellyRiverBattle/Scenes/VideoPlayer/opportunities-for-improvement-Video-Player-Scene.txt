Opportunities for Improvement

Video Player Scene. current fps around 45 fps.

Change the design of UI buttons to depict cave Hand Paintings.
Change the screen player mesh to a curved rectangle.
Add a panel on the right or left of the video screen to display textual information about the video playing (e.g., credits, date, description, etc.).
Assess the resolution of the video. We may improve performance by reducing video resolution and reducing video screen size. In Quest2 hub the UI is about half of the screen or smaller, and is very close to the camera view.
	Oculus Quest 2 has a resolution of 1832x1920 pixels per eye, you want to create textures that match this resolution or lower. 
	Curent video resolutin is 1280x720.
Change the shape of auroras to match the map.

Changiging terain size and resolution may also affect performance. Check it. Since the terrain is very dark, we may have be able to have a low resolutin without noticing it, as well as a smaller size terrain.
